## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The resuls of the multiple linear regression to predict MPG are as follows:

According to this data the intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the mpg appears to change as the vehicle length and ground clearance changes. This linear model does not appear to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. Though the adjusted R-squared value is at .68, which is a decent number, the fact that the intercept appears to provide variance to the mpg shows that there likely need to be further adjustments to the model to make it fit better. There is also a chance of overfitting since only two of the five variables show a correlation.
